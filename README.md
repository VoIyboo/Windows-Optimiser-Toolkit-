Quinn Optimiser Toolkit

A modular Windows optimisation and IT utility suite built in PowerShell and WPF.

⚠️ Project Status

The toolkit is actively in development. V1 and V2 are complete. V3 is now focused on rebuilding the UI safely, improving structure and introducing Studio Voly branding. The previous experimental V3 (dashboards, analytics etc.) pushed the codebase too far too fast, so it has been retired and moved to a future version.

The project has been rolled back to the stable V2.7 base while the new V3 UI and GitHub structure are rebuilt properly.

Treat the toolkit as evolving and experimental during this transition.

🧩 Project Overview

The Quinn Optimiser Toolkit started as a simple Windows cleanup script and has grown into a multi module, UI driven optimisation suite for IT professionals. It focuses on:

• System cleanups
• Debloating
• App installation and removal
• Windows performance tweaks
• System health utilities
• Safe and Advanced modes
• Logging
• Modular design for future expansion

The long term vision is an all in one IT support utility.

✅ Version Breakdown

V1 Core Script (Completed)

The original single script that proved the concept.

Included:

• Windows Update cache cleanup
• Delivery Optimisation cleanup
• Temp folders
• WinSxS safe cleanup
• Windows.old removal
• Dump and log removal
• Old restore point cleanup

No UI and no modules yet, just raw optimisation.

V2 UI and Modular System (Completed)

V2 introduced the full WPF UI and a proper modular design.

Key features:

• Tabs for Cleaning, Tweaks, Apps and Advanced
• Checkbox based UI
• Logging system
• App scan and uninstall logic
• Basic Windows tweaks
• Loading indicators
• GitHub friendly layout

Stable foundation. V2.7 is the current reliable release.

V3 UI Rebuild and GitHub Migration (In Progress – Active Development)

The new V3 is all about strengthening the project’s structure:

• Moving all logic into a clean GitHub repository
• Rebuilding the WPF UI to be more stable and readable
• Introducing Studio Voly branding, style and animations
• Improved window loading behaviour
• Better intro screen handling
• A cleaner file and engine layout

No new advanced logic is being added in this version.
V3 is strictly UI, structure and branding.

Advanced features previously planned for V3 have been moved to V4 and beyond.

V4 Smart Toolkit Upgrade (Planning Stage)

This version will reintroduce the ambitious features:

• Dashboard and system health analytics
• App intelligence and scoring
• Preset modes such as Safe, Balanced and Expert
• Deeper Windows optimisation logic
• More automation and background processing

These features will only be built once the V3 foundation is solid.

V5 Imaging and Deployment Module (Concept Stage)

Future large scale capability:

• Sysprep preparation
• Capture to WIM
• Export to USB or external media
• Optional WinPE workflows
• High level safeguards for IT admins

🚧 Important Notes

• Current stable version: V2.7
• V3 is actively being rebuilt for UI, structure and branding
• Previous V3 experimental features are postponed
• GitHub migration is ongoing
• Expect placeholders and rapid changes while the rebuild continues
• V4 and V5 are future development stages

💡 Contribution / Feedback

This is currently a solo build, but contribution, ideas and feature requests will open once the new V3 stabilises.
