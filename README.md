Quinn Optimiser Toolkit

A modular Windows optimisation and IT utility suite built in PowerShell and WPF.

⚠️ Project Status

The toolkit is actively in development. V1 and V2 are complete, and V3 began rolling out, however a recent update pushed the UI and app engine a bit too far. V3 broke harder than expected, so the project has been rolled back to the stable V2.7 codebase.

Work is currently underway to restore the GitHub structure, fix the app load and crash behaviour, and rebuild the V3 features more safely and modularly.

Treat the project as evolving and experimental while these repairs are in progress.

🧩 Project Overview

The Quinn Optimiser Toolkit started as a simple Windows cleanup script and has grown into a multi module, UI driven optimisation suite designed for IT professionals. It focuses on:

• System cleanups
• Debloating
• App installation and removal
• Windows performance tweaks
• System health dashboards
• Safe and Advanced modes
• Logging
• Modular design for future enhancements

Long term, the goal is to create an all in one IT support utility.

✅ Version Breakdown

V1
Core Script (Completed)

The first version was a single PowerShell script focused on safe cleanups:

• Windows Update cache
• Delivery Optimisation cache
• Temp folders
• WinSxS safe cleanup
• Windows.old removal
• Dump and log removal
• Old restore point cleanup

V1 had no UI, no modules and no app logic. It proved the concept worked.

V2
UI and Modular System (Completed)

V2 introduced a full WPF UI and separated logic into modules. This made the toolkit a proper application.

Key features:

• Tabs for Cleaning, Tweaks, Apps and Advanced
• Checkbox UI
• Logging system
• Risk colour coding
• App scan and uninstall logic
• Basic Windows tweaks
• Loading indicators
• Cleaner structure for GitHub

V3
Smart Toolkit Upgrade (Rolled Back – Under Repair)

V3 is where the toolkit attempted a major leap: dashboards, health analytics, preset modes, deeper app intelligence and theming.

The ideas stay, but the build became unstable and caused app crashes. Because of this:

• V3 has been rolled back to stable V2.7
• The GitHub repository is being restored
• The app structure is being fixed
• V3 modules will be rebuilt more safely and piece by piece

V4
Imaging and Deployment Module (Planning Stage)

A future concept focusing on IT admin imaging features:

• Sysprep preparation
• Capture to WIM
• Export to USB or external media
• Optional WinPE workflows
• Heavy safeguards

This is not started yet.

🚧 Important Notes

• V3 is temporarily disabled while repairs happen
• V2.7 is the stable and current live version
• GitHub is being rebuilt
• Expect breakage, rewrites and placeholders during restoration
• V4 is future planning only

💡 Contribution / Feedback

This is a solo build for now. Real contributions and feature requests will open once V3 stabilises again.
